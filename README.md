# v13 — Reactions + dark-mode default

- Capsule chat + **message reactions** (👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 👏). Click to toggle; counts sync live via Supabase Realtime.
- **Dark mode by default** (html has `class="dark"`). You can add a toggle later if you want.
- No Radix popover dependency; build error fixed.

Install:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Deploy on Vercel with your same env vars.
